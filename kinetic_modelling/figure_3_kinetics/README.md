# `Figure 3`

Contents of this folder:

1. `energy_files`: Inputs .txt files to CatMAP
2. `run`: Calculation files with [aiida-catmap](https://github.com/sudarshanv01/aiida-catmap)
3. `analysis`: Scripts to plot Figure 4 based on the catmap calculations.
4. `aiida_exports`: Has the `.zip` file which can be read into AiiDA using `verdi archive import kinetic_modelling_data.zip`

Optionally, if you just want to access the final result without the AiiDA nodes, look at `analysis/aiida_output/kinetic_model_data.json`
