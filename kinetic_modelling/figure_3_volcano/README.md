Kinetic modelling of CO2 to CO using AiiDA-CatMAP
-------------------------------------------------

1. energy_files: raw .txt files that are converted into SingleFileNodes
2. mkm_run_files: Recipies of the the .mkm file which is fed into AiiDACatMAP
3. analysis: contains the scripts with plots the final figure
4. export: (TODO) contains the export node file from AiiDA which can be read in
